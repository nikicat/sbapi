From the beginning there was only one provider for such lists - Google. About a year ago Yandex have started to provide similar service with compatible API.\r\nHere is [the sbdownload.sh script](https://gist.github.com/3933558) that downloads all the chunks for malware blacklist and outputs some useful info:\r\n```\r\n$ ./sbdownload.sh \r\nhave: a:94081-95769,91521-94080,89441-91520,88801-89440,87041-88800,85441-87040,85093-85440:s:97561-99065,95361-97600,94001-95360,93441-94080,91961-93440,90561-92160,90241-90560\r\nchunks: 19823\r\nfiles: 73\r\nsize: 7906554\r\n$ ./sbdownload.sh yandex\r\nhave: a:13373-13452,13293-13372,13213-13292,13133-13212,13053-13132,12973-13052,12893-12972,12813-12892,12801-12812:s:11676-11715,11636-11675,11596-11635,11556-11595,11516-11555,11476-11515,11436-11475,11396-11435,11356-11395,11316-11355,11302-11315\r\nchunks: 1067\r\nfiles: 1067\r\nsize: 1869909\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, Google consolidates chunks so you finally need to download only 73 files for ~8MB database and Yandex provides each chunk in a separate file so there are 1067 files for <2MB database.\r\nAlso, Google have way more chunks than Yandex, possibly because Yandex resets the whole database sometimes. I have no historical data about either API, but it must not be too hard to implement such monitoring in the future.\r\n\r\nFeel free to fix this page.","google":"UA-35781413-1","tagline":"nikicat's blog"}
